# Future Architecture Research - DEFERRED

**Status**: RESEARCH ONLY - NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Decision Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Reason**: Complexity/risk assessment favors maintaining current stable system

## Rule Zero Assessment Summary

This document contained valuable architectural research for potential future enhancements to the Sigil Protocol implementation. However, following Rule Zero principles:

- **Alignment**: Current v1.3.1 system meets requirements effectively
- **Validation**: Risk of regression outweighs potential benefits  
- **Transparency**: Implementation complexity would reduce maintainability
- **Adaptability**: Incremental approach preserves system stability

## Key Research Findings

The research identified several valid enhancement opportunities:
- Dynamic canon source registration
- Enhanced trust decision matrices
- Production optimization patterns
- Security layer improvements

## Future Consideration Criteria

This research should only be reconsidered if:
1. Current system demonstrates measurable limitations
2. User requirements explicitly demand these features
3. Full validation and testing infrastructure is in place
4. Implementation can be done incrementally with feature flags

## Current Recommendation

**MAINTAIN CURRENT STABLE SYSTEM** - Focus on:
- Bug fixes and maintenance
- User-reported issues
- Small, isolated improvements
- Documentation and testing improvements
