You\u2019ll find [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") and [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") types for working as either a client or a server as well as all of their components. Notably you\u2019ll find `Uri` for what a [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") is requesting, a [`Method`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/method/struct.Method.html \"struct http::method::Method\") for how it\u2019s being requested, a [`StatusCode`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/status/struct.StatusCode.html \"struct http::status::StatusCode\") for what sort of response came back, a [`Version`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/version/struct.Version.html \"struct http::version::Version\") for how this was communicated, and [`HeaderName`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderName.html \"struct http::header::HeaderName\")/[`HeaderValue`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html \"struct http::header::HeaderValue\") definitions to get grouped in a [`HeaderMap`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderMap.html \"struct http::header::HeaderMap\") to work with request/response headers.\nYou will notably _not_ find an implementation of sending requests or spinning up a server in this crate. It\u2019s intended that this crate is the \u201cstandard library\u201d for HTTP clients and servers without dictating any particular implementation.\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#requests-and-responses)Requests and Responses\nPerhaps the main two types in this crate are the [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") and [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") types. A [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") could either be constructed to get sent off as a client or it can also be received to generate a [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") for a server. Similarly as a client a [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") is what you get after sending a [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\"), whereas on a server you\u2019ll be manufacturing a [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") to send back to the client.\nEach type has a number of accessors for the component fields. For as a server you might want to inspect a requests URI to dispatch it:\n```\nuse http::{Request, Response};\nfn response(req: Request<()>) -> http::Result<Response<()>> {\n  match req.uri().path() {\n    \"/\" => index(req),\n    \"/foo\" => foo(req),\n    \"/bar\" => bar(req),\n    _ => not_found(req),\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn a [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") you\u2019ll also find accessors like [`method`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html#method.method \"method http::request::Request::method\") to return a [`Method`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/method/struct.Method.html \"struct http::method::Method\") and [`headers`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html#method.method \"method http::request::Request::method\") to inspect the various headers. A [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") has similar methods for headers, the status code, etc.\nIn addition to getters, request/response types also have mutable accessors to edit the request/response:\n```\nuse http::{HeaderValue, Response, StatusCode};\nuse http::header::CONTENT_TYPE;\nfn add_server_headers<T>(response: &mut Response<T>) {\n  response.headers_mut()\n    .insert(CONTENT_TYPE, HeaderValue::from_static(\"text/html\"));\n  *response.status_mut() = StatusCode::OK;\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally, one of the most important aspects of requests/responses, the body! The [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") and [`Response`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\") types in this crate are _generic_ in what their body is. This allows downstream libraries to use different representations such as `Request<Vec<u8>>`, `Response<impl Read>`, `Request<impl Stream<Item = Vec<u8>, Error = _>>`, or even `Response<MyCustomType>` where the custom type was deserialized from JSON.\nThe body representation is intentionally flexible to give downstream libraries maximal flexibility in implementing the body as appropriate.\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#http-headers)HTTP Headers\nAnother major piece of functionality in this library is HTTP header interpretation and generation. The `HeaderName` type serves as a way to define header _names_ , or what\u2019s to the left of the colon. A `HeaderValue` conversely is the header _value_ , or what\u2019s to the right of a colon.\nFor example, if you have an HTTP request that looks like:\n```\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/html\n```\n\nThen `\"Accept\"` is a [`HeaderName`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderName.html \"struct http::header::HeaderName\") while `\"text/html\"` is a [`HeaderValue`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html \"struct http::header::HeaderValue\"). Each of these is a dedicated type to allow for a number of interesting optimizations and to also encode the static guarantees of each type. For example a [`HeaderName`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderName.html \"struct http::header::HeaderName\") is always a valid `&str`, but a [`HeaderValue`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html \"struct http::header::HeaderValue\") may not be valid UTF-8.\nThe most common header names are already defined for you as constant values in the [`header`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/index.html \"mod http::header\") module of this crate. For example:\n```\nuse http::header::{self, HeaderName};\nlet name: HeaderName = header::ACCEPT;\nassert_eq!(name.as_str(), \"accept\");\n```\n\nYou can, however, also parse header names from strings:\n```\nuse http::header::{self, HeaderName};\nlet name = \"Accept\".parse::<HeaderName>().unwrap();\nassert_eq!(name, header::ACCEPT);\n```\n\nHeader values can be created from string literals through the [`from_static`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html#method.from_static \"associated function http::header::HeaderValue::from_static\") function:\n```\nuse http::HeaderValue;\nlet value = HeaderValue::from_static(\"text/html\");\nassert_eq!(value.as_bytes(), b\"text/html\");\n```\n\nAnd header values can also be parsed like names:\n```\nuse http::HeaderValue;\nlet value = \"text/html\";\nlet value = value.parse::<HeaderValue>().unwrap();\n```\n\nMost HTTP requests and responses tend to come with more than one header, so it\u2019s not too useful to just work with names and values only! This crate also provides a [`HeaderMap`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderMap.html \"struct http::header::HeaderMap\") type which is a specialized hash map for keys as [`HeaderName`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderName.html \"struct http::header::HeaderName\") and generic values. This type, like header names, is optimized for common usage but should continue to scale with your needs over time.\n## [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#uris)URIs\nEach HTTP [`Request`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\") has an associated URI with it. This may just be a path like `/index.html` but it could also be an absolute URL such as `https://www.rust-lang.org/index.html`. A [`URI`](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/uri/struct.Uri.html \"struct http::uri::Uri\") has a number of accessors to interpret it:\n```\nuse http::Uri;\nuse http::uri::Scheme;\nlet uri = \"https://www.rust-lang.org/index.html\".parse::<Uri>().unwrap();\nassert_eq!(uri.scheme(), Some(&Scheme::HTTPS));\nassert_eq!(uri.host(), Some(\"www.rust-lang.org\"));\nassert_eq!(uri.path(), \"/index.html\");\nassert_eq!(uri.query(), None);\n```\n\n## Re-exports[\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#reexports)\n\n`pub use crate::header::HeaderMap[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderMap.html \"struct http::header::HeaderMap\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::header::HeaderName[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderName.html \"struct http::header::HeaderName\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::header::HeaderValue[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html \"struct http::header::HeaderValue\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::method::Method[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/method/struct.Method.html \"struct http::method::Method\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::request::Request[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/struct.Request.html \"struct http::request::Request\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::response::Response[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/struct.Response.html \"struct http::response::Response\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::status::StatusCode[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/status/struct.StatusCode.html \"struct http::status::StatusCode\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::uri::Uri[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/uri/struct.Uri.html \"struct http::uri::Uri\");`\n\n\n`pub use crate::version::Version[](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/version/struct.Version.html \"struct http::version::Version\");`\n\n## Modules[\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#modules)\n\n[header](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/header/index.html \"mod http::header\")\n    HTTP header types\n\n[method](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/method/index.html \"mod http::method\")\n    The HTTP request method\n\n[request](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/request/index.html \"mod http::request\")\n    HTTP request types.\n\n[response](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/response/index.html \"mod http::response\")\n    HTTP response types.\n\n[status](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/status/index.html \"mod http::status\")\n    HTTP status codes\n\n[uri](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/uri/index.html \"mod http::uri\")\n    URI component of request and response lines\n\n[version](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/version/index.html \"mod http::version\")\n    HTTP version\n## Structs[\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#structs)\n\n[Error](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/struct.Error.html \"struct http::Error\")\n    A generic \u201cerror\u201d for HTTP connections\n\n[Extensions](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/struct.Extensions.html \"struct http::Extensions\")\n    A type map of protocol extensions.\n## Type Aliases[\u00a7](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/#types)\n\n[Result](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/type.Result.html \"type http::Result\")\n    A `Result` typedef to use with the `http::Error` type\n",

Notably, it does not handle sending requests or hosting servers, serving instead as a \"standard library\" for HTTP-related functionality.",

    "factual_counterfactual": "### Pair 1: Request and Response Handling  \n\u2705 **Factual:** The `http` crate provides generic `Request` and `Response` types that allow users to define custom body representations, such as `Request<Vec<u8>>` or `Response<impl Read>`.  \n\u274c **Counterfactual:** The `http` crate includes built-in functionality to send HTTP requests and spin up an HTTP server directly.  \n\n---\n\n### Pair 2: Header Management  \n\u2705 **Factual:** The `http` crate provides the `HeaderMap` type, which is a specialized hash map for managing HTTP headers efficiently, with keys as `HeaderName` and values as `HeaderValue`.  \n\u274c **Counterfactual:** The `http` crate only supports string-based headers and does not provide dedicated types like `HeaderName` or `HeaderValue` for structured header management.  \n\n---\n\n### Pair 3: URI Parsing  \n\u2705 **Factual:** The `http` crate's `Uri` type supports parsing and accessing components of both relative paths (e.g., `/index.html`) and absolute URLs (e.g., `https://www.rust-lang.org/index.html`).  \n\u274c **Counterfactual:** The `http` crate can only parse relative paths as URIs and does not support parsing absolute URLs.",
