Notably, they use such a parameter for the return value, allowing it to be inferred by the type checker based on the desired signature type.\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#alternatives-considered)Alternatives considered\nThis crate is based on many years of exploration of how to encapsulate digital signature systems in the most flexible, developer-friendly way. During that time many design alternatives were explored, tradeoffs compared, and ultimately the provided API was selected.\nThe tradeoffs made in this API have all been to improve simplicity, ergonomics, type safety, and flexibility for _consumers_ of the traits. At times, this has come at a cost to implementers. Below are some concerns we are cognizant of which were considered in the design of the API:\n  * \u201cBag-of-bytes\u201d serialization precludes signature providers from using their own internal representation of a signature, which can be helpful for many reasons (e.g. advanced signature system features like batch verification).\n  * Associated types, rather than generic parameters of traits, could allow more customization of the types used by a particular signature system, e.g. using custom error types.\n\n\nIt may still make sense to continue to explore the above tradeoffs, but with a _new_ set of traits which are intended to be implementor-friendly, rather than consumer friendly. The existing [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait signature::Signer\") and [`Verifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Verifier.html \"trait signature::Verifier\") traits could have blanket impls for the \u201cprovider-friendly\u201d traits. However, as noted above this is a design space easily explored after stabilizing the consumer-oriented traits, and thus we consider these more important.\nThat said, below are some caveats of trying to design such traits, and why we haven\u2019t actively pursued them:\n  * Generics in the return position are already used to select which trait impl to use, i.e. for a particular signature algorithm/system. Avoiding a unified, concrete signature type adds another dimension to complexity and compiler errors, and in our experience makes them unsuitable for this sort of API. We believe such an API is the natural one for signature systems, reflecting the natural way they are written absent a trait.\n  * Associated types preclude multiple implementations of the same trait. These parameters are common in signature systems, notably ones which support different serializations of a signature (e.g. raw vs ASN.1).\n  * Digital signatures are almost always larger than the present 32-entry trait impl limitation on array types, which complicates bounds for these types (particularly things like `From` or `Borrow` bounds).\n\n\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#unstable-features)Unstable features\nDespite being post-1.0, this crate includes off-by-default unstable optional features, each of which depends on a pre-1.0 crate.\nThese features are considered exempt from SemVer. See the [SemVer policy](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#semver-policy) above for more information.\nThe following unstable features are presently supported:\n  * `digest`: enables the [`DigestSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestSigner.html \"trait signature::DigestSigner\") and [`DigestVerifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestVerifier.html \"trait signature::DigestVerifier\") traits which are based on the [`Digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) trait from the [`digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) crate. These traits are used for representing signature systems based on the [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic) which compute a random challenge value to sign by computing a cryptographically secure digest of the input message.\n  * `rand_core`: enables the [`RandomizedSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.RandomizedSigner.html \"trait signature::RandomizedSigner\") trait for signature systems which rely on a cryptographically secure random number generator for security.\n\n\nNOTE: the [`async-signature`](https://docs.rs/async-signature) crate contains experimental `async` support for [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait signature::Signer\") and [`DigestSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestSigner.html \"trait signature::DigestSigner\").\n##

Notably, they use such a parameter for the return value, allowing it to be inferred by the type checker based on the desired signature type.\n### \u00a7\u27e831\u27e9Alternatives considered\nThis crate is based on many years of exploration of how to encapsulate digital signature systems in the most flexible, developer-friendly way. During that time many design alternatives were explored, tradeoffs compared, and ultimately the provided API was selected.\nThe tradeoffs made in this API have all been to improve simplicity, ergonomics, type safety, and flexibility for _consumers_ of the traits. At times, this has come at a cost to implementers. Below are some concerns we are cognizant of which were considered in the design of the API:\n  * \u201cBag-of-bytes\u201d serialization precludes signature providers from using their own internal representation of a signature, which can be helpful for many reasons (e.g. advanced signature system features like batch verification).\n  * Associated types, rather than generic parameters of traits, could allow more customization of the types used by a particular signature system, e.g. using custom error types.\n\n\nIt may still make sense to continue to explore the above tradeoffs, but with a _new_ set of traits which are intended to be implementor-friendly, rather than consumer friendly. The existing `Signer`\u27e829\u27e9 and `Verifier`\u27e830\u27e9 traits could have blanket impls for the \u201cprovider-friendly\u201d traits. However, as noted above this is a design space easily explored after stabilizing the consumer-oriented traits, and thus we consider these more important.\nThat said, below are some caveats of trying to design such traits, and why we haven\u2019t actively pursued them:\n  * Generics in the return position are already used to select which trait impl to use, i.e. for a particular signature algorithm/system. Avoiding a unified, concrete signature type adds another dimension to complexity and compiler errors, and in our experience makes them unsuitable for this sort of API. We believe such an API is the natural one for signature systems, reflecting the natural way they are written absent a trait.\n  * Associated types preclude multiple implementations of the same trait. These parameters are common in signature systems, notably ones which support different serializations of a signature (e.g. raw vs ASN.1).\n  * Digital signatures are almost always larger than the present 32-entry trait impl limitation on array types, which complicates bounds for these types (particularly things like `From` or `Borrow` bounds).\n\n\n### \u00a7\u27e832\u27e9Unstable features\nDespite being post-1.0, this crate includes off-by-default unstable optional features, each of which depends on a pre-1.0 crate.\nThese features are considered exempt from SemVer. See the SemVer policy\u27e820\u27e9 above for more information.\nThe following unstable features are presently supported:\n  * `digest`: enables the `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 and `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9 traits which are based on the `Digest`\u27e835\u27e9 trait from the `digest`\u27e835\u27e9 crate. These traits are used for representing signature systems based on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic\u27e836\u27e9 which compute a random challenge value to sign by computing a cryptographically secure digest of the input message.\n  * `rand_core`: enables the `RandomizedSigner`\u27e837\u27e9 trait for signature systems which rely on a cryptographically secure random number generator for security.\n\n\nNOTE: the `async-signature`\u27e838\u27e9 crate contains experimental `async` support for `Signer`\u27e829\u27e9 and `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9.\n## Re-exports\u00a7\u27e839\u27e9\n\n`pub use digest[](https://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/digest/index.html \"mod digest\");``digest`\n\n\n`pub use rand_core[](https://docs.rs/rand_core/0.6.4/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rand_core/index.html \"mod rand_core\");``rand_core`\n\n## Modules\u00a7\u27e840\u27e9\n\nhazmat\u27e841\u27e9\n    Hazardous Materials: low-level APIs which can be insecure if misused.\n## Structs\u00a7\u27e842\u27e9\n\nError\u27e843\u27e9\n    Signature errors.\n## Traits\u00a7\u27e844\u27e9\n\nDigestSigner\u27e833\u27e9`digest`\n    Sign the given prehashed message `Digest`\u27e845\u27e9 using `Self`.\n\nDigestVerifier\u27e834\u27e9`digest`\n    Verify the provided signature for the given prehashed message `Digest`\u27e845\u27e9 is authentic.\n\nKeypair\u27e846\u27e9\n    Signing keypair with an associated verifying key.\n\nKeypairRef\u27e847\u27e9\n    Signing keypair with an associated verifying key.\n\nPrehashSignature\u27e848\u27e9`digest`\n    Marker trait for `Signature` types computable as `\ud835\udc12(\ud835\udc07(\ud835\udc8e))` i.e. ones which prehash a message to be signed as `\ud835\udc07(\ud835\udc8e)`\n\nRandomizedDigestSigner\u27e849\u27e9`digest` and `rand_core`\n    Combination of `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 and `RandomizedSigner`\u27e837\u27e9 with support for computing a signature over a digest which requires entropy from an RNG.\n\nRandomizedSigner\u27e837\u27e9`rand_core`\n    Sign the given message using the provided external randomness source.\n\nSignatureEncoding\u27e850\u27e9\n    Support for decoding/encoding signatures as bytes.\n\nSigner\u27e829\u27e9\n    Sign the provided message bytestring using `Self` (e.g. a cryptographic key or connection to an HSM), returning a digital signature.\n\nSignerMut\u27e851\u27e9\n    Sign the provided message bytestring using `&mut Self` (e.g. an evolving cryptographic key such as a stateful hash-based signature), returning a digital signature.\n\nVerifier\u27e830\u27e9\n    Verify the provided message bytestring using `Self` (e.g. a public key)\n## Type Aliases\u00a7\u27e852\u27e9\n\nResult\u27e853\u27e9\n    Result type.\n## Derive Macros\u00a7\u27e854\u27e9\n\nDigestSigner\u27e855\u27e9`derive` and `digest`\n    Derive the `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `PrehashSigner`\u27e856\u27e9.\n\nDigestVerifier\u27e857\u27e9`derive` and `digest`\n    Derive the `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `PrehashVerifier`\u27e858\u27e9.\n\nSigner\u27e859\u27e9`derive`\n    Derive the `Signer`\u27e859\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9.\n\nVerifier\u27e860\u27e9`derive`\n    Derive the `Verifier`\u27e860\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9.\n",

Notably, they use such a parameter for the return value, allowing it to be inferred by the type checker based on the desired signature type.\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#alternatives-considered)Alternatives considered\nThis crate is based on many years of exploration of how to encapsulate digital signature systems in the most flexible, developer-friendly way. During that time many design alternatives were explored, tradeoffs compared, and ultimately the provided API was selected.\nThe tradeoffs made in this API have all been to improve simplicity, ergonomics, type safety, and flexibility for _consumers_ of the traits. At times, this has come at a cost to implementers. Below are some concerns we are cognizant of which were considered in the design of the API:\n  * \u201cBag-of-bytes\u201d serialization precludes signature providers from using their own internal representation of a signature, which can be helpful for many reasons (e.g. advanced signature system features like batch verification).\n  * Associated types, rather than generic parameters of traits, could allow more customization of the types used by a particular signature system, e.g. using custom error types.\n\n\nIt may still make sense to continue to explore the above tradeoffs, but with a _new_ set of traits which are intended to be implementor-friendly, rather than consumer friendly. The existing [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait signature::Signer\") and [`Verifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Verifier.html \"trait signature::Verifier\") traits could have blanket impls for the \u201cprovider-friendly\u201d traits. However, as noted above this is a design space easily explored after stabilizing the consumer-oriented traits, and thus we consider these more important.\nThat said, below are some caveats of trying to design such traits, and why we haven\u2019t actively pursued them:\n  * Generics in the return position are already used to select which trait impl to use, i.e. for a particular signature algorithm/system. Avoiding a unified, concrete signature type adds another dimension to complexity and compiler errors, and in our experience makes them unsuitable for this sort of API. We believe such an API is the natural one for signature systems, reflecting the natural way they are written absent a trait.\n  * Associated types preclude multiple implementations of the same trait. These parameters are common in signature systems, notably ones which support different serializations of a signature (e.g. raw vs ASN.1).\n  * Digital signatures are almost always larger than the present 32-entry trait impl limitation on array types, which complicates bounds for these types (particularly things like `From` or `Borrow` bounds).\n\n\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#unstable-features)Unstable features\nDespite being post-1.0, this crate includes off-by-default unstable optional features, each of which depends on a pre-1.0 crate.\nThese features are considered exempt from SemVer. See the [SemVer policy](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#semver-policy) above for more information.\nThe following unstable features are presently supported:\n  * `digest`: enables the [`DigestSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestSigner.html \"trait signature::DigestSigner\") and [`DigestVerifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestVerifier.html \"trait signature::DigestVerifier\") traits which are based on the [`Digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) trait from the [`digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) crate. These traits are used for representing signature systems based on the [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic) which compute a random challenge value to sign by computing a cryptographically secure digest of the input message.\n  * `rand_core`: enables the [`RandomizedSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.RandomizedSigner.html \"trait signature::RandomizedSigner\") trait for signature systems which rely on a cryptographically secure random number generator for security.\n\n\nNOTE: the [`async-signature`](https://docs.rs/async-signature) crate contains experimental `async` support for [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait

Notably, they use such a parameter for the return value, allowing it to be inferred by the type checker based on the desired signature type.\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#alternatives-considered)Alternatives considered\nThis crate is based on many years of exploration of how to encapsulate digital signature systems in the most flexible, developer-friendly way. During that time many design alternatives were explored, tradeoffs compared, and ultimately the provided API was selected.\nThe tradeoffs made in this API have all been to improve simplicity, ergonomics, type safety, and flexibility for _consumers_ of the traits. At times, this has come at a cost to implementers. Below are some concerns we are cognizant of which were considered in the design of the API:\n  * \u201cBag-of-bytes\u201d serialization precludes signature providers from using their own internal representation of a signature, which can be helpful for many reasons (e.g. advanced signature system features like batch verification).\n  * Associated types, rather than generic parameters of traits, could allow more customization of the types used by a particular signature system, e.g. using custom error types.\n\n\nIt may still make sense to continue to explore the above tradeoffs, but with a _new_ set of traits which are intended to be implementor-friendly, rather than consumer friendly. The existing [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait signature::Signer\") and [`Verifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Verifier.html \"trait signature::Verifier\") traits could have blanket impls for the \u201cprovider-friendly\u201d traits. However, as noted above this is a design space easily explored after stabilizing the consumer-oriented traits, and thus we consider these more important.\nThat said, below are some caveats of trying to design such traits, and why we haven\u2019t actively pursued them:\n  * Generics in the return position are already used to select which trait impl to use, i.e. for a particular signature algorithm/system. Avoiding a unified, concrete signature type adds another dimension to complexity and compiler errors, and in our experience makes them unsuitable for this sort of API. We believe such an API is the natural one for signature systems, reflecting the natural way they are written absent a trait.\n  * Associated types preclude multiple implementations of the same trait. These parameters are common in signature systems, notably ones which support different serializations of a signature (e.g. raw vs ASN.1).\n  * Digital signatures are almost always larger than the present 32-entry trait impl limitation on array types, which complicates bounds for these types (particularly things like `From` or `Borrow` bounds).\n\n\n### [\u00a7](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#unstable-features)Unstable features\nDespite being post-1.0, this crate includes off-by-default unstable optional features, each of which depends on a pre-1.0 crate.\nThese features are considered exempt from SemVer. See the [SemVer policy](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/#semver-policy) above for more information.\nThe following unstable features are presently supported:\n  * `digest`: enables the [`DigestSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestSigner.html \"trait signature::DigestSigner\") and [`DigestVerifier`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestVerifier.html \"trait signature::DigestVerifier\") traits which are based on the [`Digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) trait from the [`digest`](https://docs.rs/digest/) crate. These traits are used for representing signature systems based on the [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic) which compute a random challenge value to sign by computing a cryptographically secure digest of the input message.\n  * `rand_core`: enables the [`RandomizedSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.RandomizedSigner.html \"trait signature::RandomizedSigner\") trait for signature systems which rely on a cryptographically secure random number generator for security.\n\n\nNOTE: the [`async-signature`](https://docs.rs/async-signature) crate contains experimental `async` support for [`Signer`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.Signer.html \"trait signature::Signer\") and [`DigestSigner`](https://docs.rs/signature/latest/signature/trait.DigestSigner.html \"trait signature::DigestSigner\").\n##

Notably, they use such a parameter for the return value, allowing it to be inferred by the type checker based on the desired signature type.\n### \u00a7\u27e831\u27e9Alternatives considered\nThis crate is based on many years of exploration of how to encapsulate digital signature systems in the most flexible, developer-friendly way. During that time many design alternatives were explored, tradeoffs compared, and ultimately the provided API was selected.\nThe tradeoffs made in this API have all been to improve simplicity, ergonomics, type safety, and flexibility for _consumers_ of the traits. At times, this has come at a cost to implementers. Below are some concerns we are cognizant of which were considered in the design of the API:\n  * \u201cBag-of-bytes\u201d serialization precludes signature providers from using their own internal representation of a signature, which can be helpful for many reasons (e.g. advanced signature system features like batch verification).\n  * Associated types, rather than generic parameters of traits, could allow more customization of the types used by a particular signature system, e.g. using custom error types.\n\n\nIt may still make sense to continue to explore the above tradeoffs, but with a _new_ set of traits which are intended to be implementor-friendly, rather than consumer friendly. The existing `Signer`\u27e829\u27e9 and `Verifier`\u27e830\u27e9 traits could have blanket impls for the \u201cprovider-friendly\u201d traits. However, as noted above this is a design space easily explored after stabilizing the consumer-oriented traits, and thus we consider these more important.\nThat said, below are some caveats of trying to design such traits, and why we haven\u2019t actively pursued them:\n  * Generics in the return position are already used to select which trait impl to use, i.e. for a particular signature algorithm/system. Avoiding a unified, concrete signature type adds another dimension to complexity and compiler errors, and in our experience makes them unsuitable for this sort of API. We believe such an API is the natural one for signature systems, reflecting the natural way they are written absent a trait.\n  * Associated types preclude multiple implementations of the same trait. These parameters are common in signature systems, notably ones which support different serializations of a signature (e.g. raw vs ASN.1).\n  * Digital signatures are almost always larger than the present 32-entry trait impl limitation on array types, which complicates bounds for these types (particularly things like `From` or `Borrow` bounds).\n\n\n### \u00a7\u27e832\u27e9Unstable features\nDespite being post-1.0, this crate includes off-by-default unstable optional features, each of which depends on a pre-1.0 crate.\nThese features are considered exempt from SemVer. See the SemVer policy\u27e820\u27e9 above for more information.\nThe following unstable features are presently supported:\n  * `digest`: enables the `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 and `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9 traits which are based on the `Digest`\u27e835\u27e9 trait from the `digest`\u27e835\u27e9 crate. These traits are used for representing signature systems based on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic\u27e836\u27e9 which compute a random challenge value to sign by computing a cryptographically secure digest of the input message.\n  * `rand_core`: enables the `RandomizedSigner`\u27e837\u27e9 trait for signature systems which rely on a cryptographically secure random number generator for security.\n\n\nNOTE: the `async-signature`\u27e838\u27e9 crate contains experimental `async` support for `Signer`\u27e829\u27e9 and `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9.\n## Re-exports\u00a7\u27e839\u27e9\n\n`pub use digest[](https://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/digest/index.html \"mod digest\");``digest`\n\n\n`pub use rand_core[](https://docs.rs/rand_core/0.6.4/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rand_core/index.html \"mod rand_core\");``rand_core`\n\n## Modules\u00a7\u27e840\u27e9\n\nhazmat\u27e841\u27e9\n    Hazardous Materials: low-level APIs which can be insecure if misused.\n## Structs\u00a7\u27e842\u27e9\n\nError\u27e843\u27e9\n    Signature errors.\n## Traits\u00a7\u27e844\u27e9\n\nDigestSigner\u27e833\u27e9`digest`\n    Sign the given prehashed message `Digest`\u27e845\u27e9 using `Self`.\n\nDigestVerifier\u27e834\u27e9`digest`\n    Verify the provided signature for the given prehashed message `Digest`\u27e845\u27e9 is authentic.\n\nKeypair\u27e846\u27e9\n    Signing keypair with an associated verifying key.\n\nKeypairRef\u27e847\u27e9\n    Signing keypair with an associated verifying key.\n\nPrehashSignature\u27e848\u27e9`digest`\n    Marker trait for `Signature` types computable as `\ud835\udc12(\ud835\udc07(\ud835\udc8e))` i.e. ones which prehash a message to be signed as `\ud835\udc07(\ud835\udc8e)`\n\nRandomizedDigestSigner\u27e849\u27e9`digest` and `rand_core`\n    Combination of `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 and `RandomizedSigner`\u27e837\u27e9 with support for computing a signature over a digest which requires entropy from an RNG.\n\nRandomizedSigner\u27e837\u27e9`rand_core`\n    Sign the given message using the provided external randomness source.\n\nSignatureEncoding\u27e850\u27e9\n    Support for decoding/encoding signatures as bytes.\n\nSigner\u27e829\u27e9\n    Sign the provided message bytestring using `Self` (e.g. a cryptographic key or connection to an HSM), returning a digital signature.\n\nSignerMut\u27e851\u27e9\n    Sign the provided message bytestring using `&mut Self` (e.g. an evolving cryptographic key such as a stateful hash-based signature), returning a digital signature.\n\nVerifier\u27e830\u27e9\n    Verify the provided message bytestring using `Self` (e.g. a public key)\n## Type Aliases\u00a7\u27e852\u27e9\n\nResult\u27e853\u27e9\n    Result type.\n## Derive Macros\u00a7\u27e854\u27e9\n\nDigestSigner\u27e855\u27e9`derive` and `digest`\n    Derive the `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `PrehashSigner`\u27e856\u27e9.\n\nDigestVerifier\u27e857\u27e9`derive` and `digest`\n    Derive the `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `PrehashVerifier`\u27e858\u27e9.\n\nSigner\u27e859\u27e9`derive`\n    Derive the `Signer`\u27e859\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `DigestSigner`\u27e833\u27e9.\n\nVerifier\u27e860\u27e9`derive`\n    Derive the `Verifier`\u27e860\u27e9 trait for a type which impls `DigestVerifier`\u27e834\u27e9.\n",
